 title={Regional participation trends for community wildfire preparedness program Firewise USA}, url={http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ace4e9}, 
 abstractNote={Community-wide wildfire mitigation can effectively protect homes from structure ignition. The Firewise USA program provides a framework for grassroots wildfire preparedness. Here, we examine the 500 Firewise USA sites in California to understand participation and demographic trends. We find important regional differences regarding the influence of underlying fire hazard, fire history, and other Firewise sites on new site formation. Sites in the Bay Area and Sierras respond strongly to fire history and proximity to other Firewise sites, while Northern and Southern California have few Firewise sites despite underlying hazardous conditions and large fire history. Firewise sites are often whiter, older, and more well-educated than California’s median population, potentially leaving out many communities that do not meet this demographic profile but face severe risks from wildfires. These findings offer important insights into the factors motivating communities to pursue wildfire protection, particularly important given recent severe and destructive wildfire seasons.},
