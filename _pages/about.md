My name is Andy Kampfschulte, I am a PhD student in the University of Southern California's Population, Health and Place program. I enjoy exploring the intersection of spatial sciences and statistics, and my research works to improve and shed light on statistical considerations in spatial public health. Spatial context is important when evaluating peoples exposures, and we need to make sure we are asking the right questions and using the right methods when incorpration spatial dimension.

I really like R programming, LateX, and musing about the importance of reproducible research. I try to extoll the values of Opensource software wherever I can, much to the annoyance of my peers.
