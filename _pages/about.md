My name is Andy Kampfschulte, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California's Population, Health and Place program. I enjoy exploring the intersection of spatial statistics and public health; my research works to improve and shed light on statistical considerations in how we tackle issues in healthcare access, neighborhood influences, and health outcomes. Spatial context is important when evaluating peoples exposures, and we need to make sure we are asking the right questions and using the right methods when incorporating a spatial dimension.

I really like R programming, LateX, and musing about the importance of reproducible research. I try to extol the values of openscience wherever I can, much to the annoyance of my peers.
